                <p>CLOUDYCAPS is a keyboard enthusiast based in the United States.
                    She first learned of making artisan keycaps back in 2020, a few months after the COVID-19 quarantine was issued. 
                    What started off as a modest pastime, gradually transformed into a deeper passion for her. 
                    It wasn't until early January of 2023 when she decided to document her journey by posting on Instagram, where shes 
                    been actively engaging with other keycap creators and keyboard enthusiasts.
