                <p>CLOUDYCAPS is a keyboard enthusiast based in the United States.
                    She first learned of making artisan keycaps back in 2020, a few months after the COVID-19 quarantine was issued. 
                    What started off as a modest pastime, gradually transformed into a deeper passion for her. 
                    It wasn't until early January of 2023 when she decided to document her journey by posting on Instagram, where she has
                    been actively engaging with other keycap creators and keyboard enthusiasts.

                <p>Her works draw inspiration from everyday life as well as other keycap creators on the 
                    platform. Together with her partner, they work together meticulously to come up with new designs 
                    on a timely basis. Each keycap is handmade and sculpted with polymer clay and finished with a 
                    glossy or matte coat.

                    As of right now, CLOUDYCAPS only offers purchases through fulfillment sales or raffles. The former allows all individuals
                    who fill out the form to purchase a keycap while the latter is a randomized selection based on a set number of premade 
                    keycaps.
                    Eventually, she would like to turn this into an in-stock store that will allow more customers to browse through various 
                    selections without filling out a form.
